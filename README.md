## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Nafis Anjoom



When I was about 10 years old, I used to think computers were magical. After years of learning, tinkering, and coding, I discovered that I was right. In my time in university, I saught in-depth understanding of interesting, foundational topics such as Computer Networking, Hardware and Operating Systems, Advanced Relational Database Management System, Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization.

I spend a lot of time learning new skills and technologies. I have built multiple web applications, both the front-end and the back-end. Right now, I am developing a chat application over WebSocket, using a custom binary message protocol.
